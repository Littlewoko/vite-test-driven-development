# Unit Tests
Test individual units of code (functions, simple components)

Low level, if it fails we are likely to go striaght to the cause

Fase

# Feature Tests
Tests a user story or feature

Higher Level - Less aware of implementation details when compared to unit tests

Integration of multiple elements - Failure point may not be immediately obvious

# End to end tests
Testing the application as a whole

Highest level - Seen from abstraction level of a user

Failure point is likely to be vague
